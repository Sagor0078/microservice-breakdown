# FastAPI with Strawberry GraphQL, SQLModel and Postgres

This project demonstrates the integration of FastAPI with Strawberry GraphQL to create a modern, scalable, and efficient web application. The application includes a sample GraphQL schema with queries and mutations, database management, and a simple FastAPI endpoint. The project also includes a PostgreSQL database for storing data and SQLModel for defining database models.

## Features
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.11 based on standard Python type hints.
- **Strawberry GraphQL**: A new GraphQL library for Python 3, inspired by dataclasses.
- **Asynchronous Database Operations**: Leveraging SQLAlchemy and async/await for high-performance database interactions.
- **Structured Project Layout**: A well-organized project structure with separate modules for models, schemas, and routes.
- **SQLModel**: A library for interacting with databases using Python type hints.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: A PostgreSQL database for storing data with SQLAlchemy as the ORM.
